# Pytorch_capstone_project
This project uses a CNN built with PyTorch to classify natural scene images from the Intel Image Classification dataset into six categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix, and visualization.
