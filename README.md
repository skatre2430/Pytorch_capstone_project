# Pytorch_capstone_project
This deep learning capstone project uses PyTorch to classify images from the Intel dataset into six categories. It includes data loading, preprocessing, CNN model design, training, evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix, and visualization of performance metrics to assess model effectiveness.
